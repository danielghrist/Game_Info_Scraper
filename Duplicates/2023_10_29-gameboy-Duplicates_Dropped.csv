Red Falcon had devoured a portion of this planet and now the vile Black Viper has come from deep space for seconds. But he hasn’t come alone. Viper’s transported a battalion of battletron tanks, stealth subs, laser cannons, and annihilating androids. And he’s seized a secret naval lab to develop a new breed of supreme alien being. So Scorpion stands alone against biological experiments gone bad like towering tarantulas and venomous vesty flies. His mission: level the lab before Viper transforms earth into an alien nation.
Although he may be a solo commando, Scorpion has an array of devastating weapons at his disposal like M-90 Shell Shocker, Fire Phazer and Homing Blaster. But it will take more than sheer firepower to survive five new lethal levels of naval ports, forests, caverns and a laboratory filled with genetic mutants.
