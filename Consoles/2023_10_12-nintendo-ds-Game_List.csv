Symbol Order: Three symbols flash on the screen in any of the 12 boxes. One symbol appears at a time for only a split second. The challenge is to remember each symbol and then enter all three symbols in the order in which they appeared.
Box Tap: Furiously tap a series of moving red boxes before they disappear. The more users successfully tap, the higher the score.
Number Flash: In this activity, numbers flash very briefly on the top screen. Users must then choose the correct number. As the activity gets harder, the number sequence gets longer.
Box Track: A circle is placed in one of three boxes. The challenge is to follow the box with the circle in it as the three shuffle rapidly on the screen. Users must then tap the box with the circle in it.
Circle Spot: In this activity, symbols appear for a split second in 12 boxes arranged on the touch screen. Users must tap the only circle among the symbols.
Letter Count: Users quickly memorize the target letter, then count how many times it appears as a fast-moving series of letters moves across the screen.
Fast Match: Users quickly look at the two symbols as they flash on the screen, then decide if they matched by tapping on the touch screen.
Baseball: Tap the ball on the touch screen as the pitch crosses the plate to score a hit. With each hit, the box gets bigger, making it more challenging to hit the speeding pitch.
Boxing: Pummel the punch mitt by tapping the center of the target before the sparring partner lowers it. Earn extra points for punching a clean hit in the center of the mitt with perfect accuracy.
Table Tennis: Users slide the stylus across the screen to volley the ball back to their opponent. Survive 40 volleys to earn a perfect score.

Boost Your Focus Power: Train with quick, fun activities based on vision-training programs used by top athletes.
Put eyes to real-world tests: Take a swing at a speeding pitch, outmaneuver incoming linebackers and strike the soccer ball into the goal in fun, sports-based training activities.
Pick up and play every day: Users complete daily training activities to challenge Hand-Eye Coordination, Peripheral Vision, Dynamic Visual Acuity, Momentary Vision and Eye Movement, then track their results with a calendar and easy-to-understand charts.",https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-ds/flash-focus-vision-training

Players take the role of the troubled engineering genius (and billionaire) Tony Stark, creator of a powerful suit of high-tech armor he wears to become the title hero. Combat takes place both on the ground and in the air, and players have access to the hero's power armor abilities, including rocket boots and repulsor rays. The game plays out across large, open, multi-objective battlefields, where Iron Man can re-purpose objects and equipment to attack enemies or cripple their defenses, as well as put his suits' arsenal to good use. As in the film and comics, different armor suit options become available as the story progresses, offering different powers.",https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-ds/iron-man

At the end of each table is a boss character, each with a distinct style of attack (and an equally distinct hidden weakness). Metroid Prime Pinball also supports a multiplayer mode, for as many as eight players, through a wireless DS connection.",https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-ds/metroid-prime-pinball

nintendo-ds,Pokemon Black,2011-03-06,Everyone,Nintendo,Game Freak,RPG,045496741273,31034,"Pokémon Black is a Nintendo game developed by Game Freak. It is supported by both the Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS systems. The release date for this Pokémon title was March 2011 in North America. It was also released alongside Pokémon White, a companion title. Both games are an RPG set in the Pokémon mythos. The main difference between Pokémon Black and Pokémon White is that each version has exclusive content. For instance, Black City is exclusive to the Black version, and White Forest is exclusive to the White version.As with most Pokémon games, Black has you play as a Pokémon trainer travelling through Unova. Unova is a Manhattan-inspired region inhabited by numerous Pokémon. The core gameplay of this game and the series is to catch Pokémon, train them, and battle against other trainers. As you win battles, you and the members of your team become increasingly more powerful. There is also the higher goal here of thwarting Team Plasma, a criminal organization that uses Pokémon for evil purposes.Although an RPG, the game is fairly linear. You travel from one story point to the next. Story points usually have a number of objectives to fulfill. In between these points, you'll engage in the activities common to games through the Pokémon series. It's worth noting that many story moments play out differently in each version. Big fans will undoubtedly want to experience both for the complete story. However, each edition tells the same core tale, so that isn't absolutely necessary.This video game is presented using an overhead, third-person view. The game contains three main screens: an overworld, a combat screen, and a menu. The overworld is a map that players use to navigate the land. The combat screen is where each battle is contested. The menu is where you adjust settings, organize your inventory, and manipulate your Pokémon roster. Configuring your equipment and roster is an important aspect of being successful in Pokémon games.Trainers capture Pokémon using Poké Balls. When a wild Pokémon is encountered, you'll automatically be challenged by another trainer. If you win, the wild Pokémon is added to your team. These creatures can earn XP, gain levels, and earn up to four moves. There are three types of moves: attack, healing, and status effect. Pokémon can also evolve. When those evolution conditions are met, your team member will change into something much stronger and more dangerous.Unique to the Black and White Pokémon video games is the Dream World. This mode provides some engaging features outside of the core game. One neat feature is the option to capture Pokémon and learn abilities that aren't present in this edition of the series. Another is the option to have other members of the community enter your Dream World and interact with it. There are also multiplayer side games that let you earn points. Those points can be used in the single-player mode to enhance your experience in a number of different ways. It also helps provide this content-packed adventure with a significant amount of replay value.",https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-ds/pokemon-black
nintendo-ds,Pokemon Black,2011-03-06,Everyone,Nintendo,Game Freak,RPG,045496741235,31034,"Pokémon Black is a Nintendo game developed by Game Freak. It is supported by both the Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS systems. The release date for this Pokémon title was March 2011 in North America. It was also released alongside Pokémon White, a companion title. Both games are an RPG set in the Pokémon mythos. The main difference between Pokémon Black and Pokémon White is that each version has exclusive content. For instance, Black City is exclusive to the Black version, and White Forest is exclusive to the White version.As with most Pokémon games, Black has you play as a Pokémon trainer travelling through Unova. Unova is a Manhattan-inspired region inhabited by numerous Pokémon. The core gameplay of this game and the series is to catch Pokémon, train them, and battle against other trainers. As you win battles, you and the members of your team become increasingly more powerful. There is also the higher goal here of thwarting Team Plasma, a criminal organization that uses Pokémon for evil purposes.Although an RPG, the game is fairly linear. You travel from one story point to the next. Story points usually have a number of objectives to fulfill. In between these points, you'll engage in the activities common to games through the Pokémon series. It's worth noting that many story moments play out differently in each version. Big fans will undoubtedly want to experience both for the complete story. However, each edition tells the same core tale, so that isn't absolutely necessary.This video game is presented using an overhead, third-person view. The game contains three main screens: an overworld, a combat screen, and a menu. The overworld is a map that players use to navigate the land. The combat screen is where each battle is contested.

Like the movie, the game revolves around the camaraderie and conflict between its two protagonists -- a student gifted with powers far too great to be constrained by his own will alone, and a teacher too devoted to honor and tradition to prevent the future he dreads most. As Anakin Skywalker, players will learn to command the unbridled power of the Dark Side, with vicious, vengeful Force power attacks and an explosively violent style of light saber fighting. As Obi-Wan Kenobi, player will ply the concentrated control and deadly effectiveness of the Light Side styles.",https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-ds/star-wars-episode-iii-revenge-of-the-sith

But the commotion that comes from taking over a planet has awakened three potential heroes in the form of Finnigan ""Fins"" Magee, Lori ""Lefty"" Lopez, and Zach ""Halfpipe"" Boyd: The Teenage Zombies. This angsty undead trio would normally be outcasts, what with their awkward appearance and habit of dining on brains, but their taste for gray matter and imperviousness to mind control make them the perfect weapons to combat an invasion of hostile brain thingys. Each of the three zombies has a unique appearance and special powers. ""Fins"" is an obese 13-year-old with squid like fins and the ability to spew toxic vomit an enemies; ""Lefty"" is a tall, one-armed 14-year-old who can smack enemies with her long right arm or attach weapons to her left stump; and ""Halfpipe"" is a 13-year-old torso who can squeeze into tight spaces thanks to his lack of legs and his tricked out skateboard.

nintendo-ds,Tomb Raider Underworld,2008-11-18,Teen,Eidos Interactive,none,Action & Adventure,788687400527,15993,"Following the franchise's legendary return to success under the direction of Crystal Dynamics, Underworld, the studio's sophomore production with Lara Croft, aims to maintain the high level of solid, free-flowing action that reinvigorated the series, while bringing back more of the spooky exploration and challenging jumping puzzles that helped define the classic Tomb Raider games of the late '90s. Developers strove to create a smooth-moving, contextually integrated character. Motion-capture technology is used for the first time in the series, with the 3D recordings of a world-class gymnast bringing Lara's jumps, flips, and kicks to life. In all, Lara's movement throughout the game incorporates over 2,000 animations. It takes a god's weapon to kill a god. Lara is set on a quest to obtain the power of Mjöllnir, the hammer of the invincible Thor. Lara's acrobatics and cunning are pushed to their limits in elaborate, sprawling platform puzzles set among ancient tombs and ruins in the jungles of Mexico, the coast of Thailand, beneath the frigid arctic seas, and in other forbidden places of mystic power around the world.",https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-ds/tomb-raider-underworld
