1. Play 11-man Football. Hey, if there aren't 11 players, it isn't real football.
2. Use real players. I want the All-Madden Team. The big boys. The flakes. The crazies...my guys.
3. Call plays from my offensive and defensive playbooks. I'm the coach, we use my plays. 81 plays in each covers the basics.
4. Design your own plays. If I pop in the right plays at the right time -- POW -- 6 points.
5. Give me realistic gameplay. There's a ton of goofball things that can happen on any given play like missed blocks, jukes and pancakes.
6. Select Player Controlled Action or Computer Action. Sometimes I want to take a handoff, hit the Umph button and jam it down your throat!
7. Don't forget gameplay conditions. Some guys aren't mudders. Some guys can't hold a block on grass. That's real football, that's in the game.
8. Call audibles. If I don't like what I see when we line up I have to get out of it. One wrong play blows the whole game or costs the coach his job.
9. Put in all the other stuff that happens. Injuries, penalties, time-outs, turnovers, interceptions, situation substitutions -- they're all part of the game.
10. Make your own league. When I build my own teams I need every pro player, player rating and key stat. I l-o-v-e being the commissioner.

He's blanketed by the zone, but I see the rookie down by the sideline. I make the read, fire a bullet, and the kid actually hauls it in, straight arms the corner and high steps down the sideline for six. Sweet. I peel myself off the turf in time to catch him cabbage patching through the paint. Then I look to the sidelines and the man says go for two---and the win.

In single player mode, the top displays the course, while the bottom screen can either display a rear-view mirror perspective, or an overhead view of the whole track, displaying where all the racers are currently. In multiplayer, the bottom screen is assigned to the second player's view.

The first single player mode is Mariokart GP, in which one player races seven computer-controlled drivers or AI. Engine classes of 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc are available (150cc is available upon acquiring gold in all the cups in 100cc). Larger engines result in faster vehicles and a greater level of difficulty. There are four cups to select: the Mushroom, Flower, Star, and Special Cups (100cc and 150cc only). Each cup consists of five tracks and the player must receive fourth place or better in any track to advance to the next. Places five through eight are given the ranked out title. The second mode is Time Trial, in which the player races through one track in an attempt to set a record for best lap time or course time.

Three multiplayer modes are also available: The first is Mariokart GP, which plays just like the single player version, but with one less computer-controlled driver. In order to proceed to the next track only one of the drivers is required to rank in the top four. The 2nd mode is Match Race, which is a one-on-one race on any track. The last mode, Battle Mode, is the only mode in which players do not race. Two players choose from four levels specially designed for battle mode and try to pop the three balloons surrounding the other player with items such as Koopa shells or banana peels. The last player with balloons wins.

In Mariokart GP and Match Race modes racers can collect coins which affect top speed and acceleration. In all modes, Lakitu rescues drivers who have driven off the track for a price of two coins. In Battle Mode and Time Trials, there are no coins and thus no charge.",https://www.pricecharting.com/game/super-nintendo/super-mario-kart

It is the third installment in the Metroid series, following the events of the Game Boy game Metroid II: Return of Samus (1991). Players control bounty hunter Samus Aran, who travels to planet Zebes to retrieve an infant Metroid creature stolen by the Space Pirate leader Ridley.

The gameplay focuses on exploration, with the player searching for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas. It features new concepts to the series, such as the inventory screen, an automap, and the ability to fire in all directions. The development staff from previous Metroid games‚Äîincluding Yoshio Sakamoto, Makoto Kano and Gunpei Yokoi returned to develop Super Metroid over the course of two years, with half a year earlier to gain approval for the initial idea. The developers wanted to make a true action game, and to set the stage for Samus's reappearance.

The game received critical acclaim, praising its atmosphere, gameplay, music and graphics. It is often cited as one of the best video games of all time. Although the game did not sell well in Japan, it fared better in North America and had shipped 1.42 million copies worldwide by late 2003. Super Metroid, alongside Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (1997), is credited for establishing the Metroidvania subgenre, and has inspired other games within the genre. It also became popular among players for speedrunning. The game was followed by the 2002 release of Metroid Fusion and Metroid Prime.

The port was coded by iD for Japanese company Imagineer. The SNES port is distinct from other ports for being censored to conform to Nintendo policies.

Imagineer bought the rights for the game, and commissioned id to port the game to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) for a US$100,000 advance. The team was busy with the development of Doom, and ignored the project for seven or eight months, finally hiring Rebecca Heineman to do the work. She made no progress on the port, however, and the id team members instead spent three weeks frantically learning how to make SNES games and creating the port by March 1993. This version made use of binary space partitioning rather than raycasting in order to give it speed. Nintendo insisted on censoring the game in accordance with their policies; this included first making all blood green and then finally removing it, removing Nazi imagery and German voice clips, and replacing enemy dogs with giant rats. The port was released in Japan on February 10, 1994 under the name Wolfenstein 3D: The Claw of Eisenfaust before being released in North America and Europe later that year.[48] Using the source code of the SNES port, on a whim John Carmack later converted the game to run on the Atari Jaguar. Atari Corporation approved the conversion for publication and Carmack spent three weeks, assisted by Dave Taylor, improving the port's graphics and quality to what he later claimed was four times more detail than the DOS version.

super-nintendo,Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel,11/1/1994,Teen,Sunsoft,Iguana Entertainment,Action & Adventure,020763110471,7255,"One day, Zero, the side-kick of the evil Edgar Ektor, receives a letter from his girlfriend Amy, which informs him of a lumberjack named Jacques Le Sheets chopping down trees and destroying his homeland for financial purposes. Despite Ektor's protestations, Zero decides that the desire to protect his land is more important that whatever villainous plans his boss might have had in mind. It's time to show that lumberjack that squirrels of dubious reputation are no strangers to the battle for environmental protection! Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel is a spin-off of the Aero the Acrobat games, its main protagonist being one of Aero's antagonists. The gameplay is similar to that of Aero the Acrobat games, involving fast-paced side-scrolling and platforming action. Zero can eliminate his enemies by executing his trademark Kamikaze Slam: spinning in the air and crushing the unlucky adversary. He can also collect shurikens (shooting stars) scattered across the levels, and use them for projectile attacks. The squirrel is able to perform double jumps to reach high platforms and jump over larger chasms.",https://www.pricecharting.com/game/super-nintendo/zero-the-kamikaze-squirrel
